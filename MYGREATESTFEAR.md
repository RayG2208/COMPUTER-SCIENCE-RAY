# My Greatest Fear: Failing to Give Back to My Parents

One of my **biggest** fears in life is not being able to give back to my parents in the future. They have sacrificed so much for me, supporting my **dreams**, providing for my **needs**, and always being there through every *challenge*. I feel a deep **responsibility** to repay them, not just with *words* but with **actions**.

# Baseball - My Process
Undoubtly my **greatest** passion, and I plan to use it as a path to university along with my academics. Through my ***hard work*** and ***dedication***, I hope to earn a scholarship, get a good education, and secure a stable job. My ultimate goal is to provide for my parents and future family, ensuring they live comfortably as a way of showing my gratitude for everything they've done.

The thought of *failing* them motivates me to push harder every day. It’s not just about personal success, it’s about making their ***sacrifices*** worth it. No matter the obstacles, I will do **everything** in my power to fulfill this promise.
