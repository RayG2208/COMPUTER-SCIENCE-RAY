# My Greatest Fear: Failing to Give Back to My Parents

One of my biggest fears in life is not being able to give back to my parents in the future. They have sacrificed so much for me—supporting my dreams, providing for my needs, and always being there through every challenge. I feel a deep responsibility to repay them, not just with words but with actions.

Baseball is my passion, and I plan to use it as a path to university. Through hard work and dedication, I hope to earn a scholarship, get a good education, and secure a stable job. My ultimate goal is to provide for my parents, ensuring they live comfortably as a way of showing my gratitude for everything they've done.

The thought of failing them motivates me to push harder every day. It’s not just about personal success—it’s about making their sacrifices worth it. No matter the obstacles, I will do everything in my power to fulfill this promise.
