# My *Greatest Fear*: **Failing** to **Give Back** to My ***Parents***
---

One of my **biggest** fears in life is not being able to give back to my parents in the future. They have sacrificed so much for me, supporting my **dreams**, providing for my **needs**, and always being there through every *challenge*. I feel a deep **responsibility** to repay them, not just with *words* but with **actions**.

Undoubtly my **greatest** passion, and I plan to use it as a path to university along with my academics. Through my ***hard work*** and ***dedication***, I hope to earn a scholarship, get a good education, and secure a stable job. My ultimate goal is to provide for my parents and future family, ensuring they live comfortably as a way of showing my gratitude for everything they've done.

The thought of *failing* them motivates me to push harder every day. It’s not just about personal success, it’s about making their ***sacrifices*** worth it. No matter the obstacles, I will do **everything** in my power to fulfill this promise.

# **All** They Have Done for Me - **My Appreciation**

Here is a **short** list on just **some** of the things my family has provided me with:
- Unconditional **Love** and **Support**
- A roof to live under my *whole life**
- The oppurunity to live in a free and better country than the one they had to grow up in
- The oppurtunity to play and proceed my passion in **Baseball**
- The countless hours they work to provide me with multiple **quality** meals

Although I could go on about how much they have ***provided*** for me, I would run out of words before I could even finish.

So this, this is why my **biggest fear** is to *fail to give back to them*, because **everyday** I am reminded on just how much they *gave* and *provided* for me, and it is absolutley ***pricelss*** to me.
